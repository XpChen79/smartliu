[options]
# these OPTION/KEY can/will be override by command line options
# --input, -i	input data folder; Must contains paired-end fastq files whose name should match the regular expression of `SAMPLE_[rR]?[12].f(ast)?q(.gz)?` (SAMPLE list is included in file specified by -s option)
# --sample, -s	one SAMPLE per line in this file; Processing will be performed on those fastq files matching with `SAMPLE_[rR]?[12].f(ast)?q(.gz)?`;
# --output, -o	output folder; existed folders is not allowed.
# --thread, -p	run in parallel-mode if THREAD > 1
# [deprecated] --mismatch, -m	allowed mismatch number when splitting fastq according to cell barcodes, 1 is recommended.
# [deprecated] --minlength, -l	min length of retained reads when paired2single
# [deprecated] --barcode, -b	a file including those barcodes used for pooling single cells in Library preparation
# [deprecated] --reference, -x	prefix of hisat2 index files used for read_mapping
# [deprecated] --gtf, -f	annotation file in gene feature format (GFF/GTF), which will be used by htseq-count
# [deprecated] --re_reference, -X	same with -x, but used by remapping
# [deprecated] --re_gtf, -F	same with -f, but used by requantify
